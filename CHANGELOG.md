# Changelog

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- Average Directional Index (ADX) — measures trend strength on a 0–100 scale with +DI and −DI directional indicators. Uses Wilder's smoothing (`α = 1/length`). Returns `AdxValue { adx, plus_di, minus_di }`. Reference tests against talipp (717 BTC/USDT bars, 1e-6 tolerance) and Criterion benchmarks.

### Changed

- ADX hot path optimized (~5% improvement): precomputed `100/smooth_tr` reciprocal replaces two divisions with one division + two multiplications; reuses push/replace return values to eliminate a redundant branch per tick.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Donchian Channel (DC) — tracks highest high and lowest low over a rolling window. Returns upper, middle, and lower bands. Default length 20. Reference tests against talipp (725 BTC/USDT bars, 1e-10 tolerance) and Criterion benchmarks.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Keltner Channel (KC) — EMA-based centre line with ATR-scaled upper/lower bands. Configurable EMA length, ATR length, and band multiplier. Reference tests against talipp (725 BTC/USDT bars, 1e-6 tolerance) and Criterion benchmarks.
- `convergence()` method on `IndicatorConfig` trait — returns the number of bars until `compute()` first returns `Some`. Each indicator implements its own formula.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Removed `EmaConfig::enforce_convergence()` and `EmaConfigBuilder::enforce_convergence()` — convergence policy is the engine's responsibility, not the indicator's. Use `EmaConfig::full_convergence()` to query how many bars are needed for the seed's influence to decay below 1%.
- **Breaking:** Removed `EmaConfig::required_bars_to_converge()` — use `convergence()` instead.
- **Breaking:** Removed `MacdConfig::convergence_bars()` — use `convergence()` instead.
- **Breaking:** Renamed `MacdConfig::full_convergence_bars()` to `full_convergence()`.
- **Breaking:** Renamed `MacdConfig` period accessors/builders to use `length` terminology: `fast_period()` → `fast_length()`, `slow_period()` → `slow_length()`, `signal_period()` → `signal_length()`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- Stochastic Oscillator (%K, %D) with reference tests against talipp (729 BTC/USDT bars, 1e-6 tolerance) and Criterion benchmarks.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- ATR (Average True Range) with Wilder's smoothing, reference tests against talipp (731 BTC/USDT bars, 1e-6 tolerance), and Criterion benchmarks.

### Changed

- Extracted `BarState` from duplicated bar-boundary detection logic in `PriceWindow`, `Ema`, and `Macd`. Centralizes `open_time` tracking, `prev_close` management, and the non-decreasing timestamp assertion into a single reusable internal type.
- SMA, EMA, and BB performance improved 46–65% (stream), 44–79% (tick), 46–79% (repaint), 42–60% (repaint stream) vs v0.3.0 due to `BarState` extraction enabling better code generation.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- WASM support: library compiles for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and full test suite runs on `wasm32-wasip1` via wasmtime.
- CI job verifying WASM compatibility on every push and PR.
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) with reference tests against talipp (711 BTC/USDT bars, 1e-6 tolerance) and Criterion benchmarks.

### Changed

- Removed `length()` from `IndicatorConfig` and `IndicatorConfigBuilder` traits — not all indicators have a single length (e.g. MACD). Each config type still exposes its own length accessor(s) as inherent methods.
- EMA performance improved 26-34% (stream), 43-49% (tick/repaint), 24-34% (repaint stream) vs v0.2.0 by eliminating redundant state in `EmaCore` hot path.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- RSI (Relative Strength Index) with Wilder's smoothing, unit tests, Criterion benchmarks, and reference tests against talipp (730 BTC/USDT bars, 1e-6 tolerance).

### Changed

- `Sma`, `Ema`, and `Bb` now expose `new()`, `compute()`, and `value()` as inherent methods, `use quantedge_ta::Indicator` is no longer required for basic usage.
- Config and builder types (`SmaConfig`, `EmaConfig`, `BbConfig` and their builders) now expose trait methods as inherent methods. `use quantedge_ta::IndicatorConfig` and `use quantedge_ta::IndicatorConfigBuilder` are no longer required for basic usage.
- Benchmark harness: deterministic codegen (`codegen-units = 1`, `lto = "thin"`), lower-overhead batching (`SmallInput`), and tuned tick-group sampling (200 samples, 5s warmup, 10s measurement, 3% noise threshold).
- `PriceWindow` now uses a `const SUM_OF_SQUARES: bool` generic so SMA no longer computes unused sum-of-squares on every tick.
- Replaced `VecDeque` with a custom `RingBuffer` in `PriceWindow`, halves buffer memory (`f64` vs `Option<f64>`), eliminates redundant modulo operations, and improves inlining. SMA and BB stream throughput improved 24-33%, tick latency improved 8-31%.
